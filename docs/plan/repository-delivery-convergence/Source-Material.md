# Styio Public Interface Roadmap for Pafio

**Purpose:** Describe the exact compiler-facing interfaces that `pafio` needs from `styio`, so future `pafio` maintainers know what to request, test, and vendor without depending on compiler internals.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-23

This file is the sequencing view.

The normative compiler handoff contract now lives in:

- [Styio-External-Interface-Requirement-Spec.md](./Styio-External-Interface-Requirement-Spec.md)

## Required Compiler Interfaces

### 1. Machine Info

Published bootstrap command:

```text
styio --machine-info=json
```

Compile-plan-live fields needed by `pafio`:

- tool identity
- compiler version
- release channel
- supported contract versions
- supported capability flags
- maximum supported edition

Current handoff expectation:

- compile-plan support advertises `[1]`
- `pafio` uses this command for handshake and compatibility gating
- `pafio` may use it as proof of project build orchestration only when the compatibility matrix also enables compile-plan v1

### 2. Compile Plan Entry

Published command:

```text
styio --compile-plan <path>
```

`pafio` needs:

- explicit acceptance or rejection of a plan version
- isolated output directories
- stable error reporting through text or JSON diagnostics
- direct black-box acceptance through `scripts/styio-interface-gate.py --require-compile-plan`

Status:

- active for compile-plan v1 and covered by `scripts/styio-interface-gate.py --require-compile-plan`
- must not be guessed or reverse-engineered from compiler internals

### 3. JSON Diagnostics

`pafio` should consume only stable machine-readable diagnostics, not human-only stderr text.

### 4. Handoff Gate

Compiler publication is not complete until the released binary passes the handshake gate:

```text
./scripts/styio-interface-gate.py --styio-bin /absolute/path/to/styio
```

and the required compile-plan handoff gate:

```text
./scripts/styio-interface-gate.py --styio-bin /absolute/path/to/styio --require-compile-plan
```

## Interface Ownership

- `pafio` owns compile-plan schema source.
- `styio` owns compiler capability declarations.
- compatibility is determined by handshake plus contract version support.

## Non-Goals

`pafio` does not need:

- direct AST access
- direct parser access
- direct type-checker access
- direct linker/runtime embedding

## Known Tradeoffs

- Waiting for formal interfaces is slower than reaching into compiler internals.
- Public interface design takes longer upfront but makes the later repository split much safer.
```

## source-002-pafio-alpha-release-checklist: Pafio Alpha Release Checklist

```text
# Pafio Alpha Release Checklist

**Purpose:** Define the concrete closure checklist for publishing `pafio` v0.1.0-alpha without implying npm-level package-manager maturity.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-05

## Release Goal

The v0.1.0-alpha release is closed when a fresh supported machine can run:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://packages.styio.dev/tools/pafio/install-pafio.sh | sh -s -- --base-url https://packages.styio.dev && pafio install styio@latest && styio --version
```

`pafio doctor` remains the supported diagnostic command, but it is not required
in the website one-liner.

The release is not expected to provide registry search, account management,
complete semver range solving, Windows/mobile installers, or signed provenance.

## Required Closure

1. Publish real `pafio` prebuilt binaries under `tools/pafio/releases/<version>/<platform>/pafio`.
2. Publish real `styio` CLI prebuilts under target namespaces:
   - `tools/styio-linux/releases/<version>/<platform>/styio`
   - `tools/styio-macos-cli/releases/<version>/<platform>/styio`
3. Maintain shell-friendly channel pointers:
   - `tools/pafio/channel/latest/<platform>/version`
   - `tools/styio-linux/channel/stable/<platform>/version`
   - `tools/styio-macos-cli/channel/stable/<platform>/version`
4. Keep `latest.json` for API consumers, but do not require JSON parsing in the user-side installer.
5. Verify all published binaries with SHA-256 sidecar files.
6. Run `pafio doctor` on each supported target before announcing the release.
7. Run a clean-machine project workflow smoke:

```sh
pafio new local/hello hello
cd hello
pafio lock
pafio check
pafio build --dry-run
pafio vendor
pafio publish --dry-run
```

## Supported Alpha Targets

The installer adapter recognizes these Linux families:

- Ubuntu/Debian
- Fedora/CentOS Stream/Alma Linux/Rocky Linux/RHEL
- Arch Linux/Manjaro
- openSUSE
- Alpine Linux

Alpha support should be announced only for platform keys that actually have
published binaries. The first local platform release closure set is:

- `darwin-aarch64`
- `linux-aarch64`
- `linux-musl-aarch64`

The x86_64 glibc and musl artifacts are deferred until CI or a preheated
builder image can produce them repeatably.

## Known Alpha Constraints

- The Linux `styio` prebuilts are dynamically linked against the platform C++
  runtime plus `zlib`, `zstd`, and, for glibc builds, `tinfo`. The installer
  adapter can identify distro families, but the alpha one-liner still assumes
  those normal runtime packages are present or installed by the operator.
- The macOS `styio` prebuilt currently links against Homebrew `zstd` through
  the LLVM 18 build used for release. A self-contained macOS CLI requires
  static zstd linkage or a multi-file archive installer.
- The musl build currently needs an Alpine LLVM 18 package workaround in the
  release builder because unused LLVM testing archive targets are declared by
  CMake metadata but not shipped by the package.
- Release builds still install roughly 1.2 GB of builder-side LLVM/Clang
  dependencies when the builder image is cold. This cost must move into CI
  image preparation before public release operations.

## Upgrade And Removal

The installer writes:

- `pafio` into the selected `--install-dir`, default `/usr/local/bin`
- `styio` shim into the same install directory unless `--no-styio-shim` is used
- `PAFIO_HOME/config/tool-release-root` when installed from a platform release root
- managed compilers under `PAFIO_HOME/tools/styio/`
- downloaded tool binaries under `PAFIO_HOME/cache/tool-releases/`

Manual removal for alpha is:

```sh
rm -f /usr/local/bin/pafio /usr/local/bin/styio
rm -rf "${PAFIO_HOME:-$HOME/.pafio}/tools/styio"
rm -rf "${PAFIO_HOME:-$HOME/.pafio}/cache/tool-releases"
```

Do not remove the whole `PAFIO_HOME` in a documented command unless the user also
wants to discard registry cache, source cache, trust metadata, and server-side
local registry state.

## Deferred Features

| Feature | Alpha stance | Estimated cost |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Full semver range solver | Defer; support pinned/latest releases | Medium, touches resolver and lock semantics |
| Registry search and discovery | Defer; package roots must be explicit | Medium, needs index/query service and CLI UX |
| Private account auth | Defer to private security module and platform | Medium to high, needs tokens, policy, and audit |
| Signed provenance | Defer; keep SHA-256 over HTTPS for alpha | Medium, needs signing keys, verification UX, CI custody |
| Windows CLI installer | Defer unless real Windows artifacts exist | Medium, needs PowerShell installer and CI target |
| Desktop/mobile package installation | Defer; platform target namespaces may exist first | High, separate packaging and app distribution paths |
| Cache garbage collection | Defer; document manual cleanup | Low to medium |
| Self-contained macOS/Linux archives | Defer past first alpha CLI smoke | Medium, needs archive metadata, RPATH/install-name handling, and runtime library policy |
| x86_64 Linux artifacts | Defer until release builder exists | Low to medium, mostly CI capacity once build scripts are stable |
```

# Pafio Audit Backlog 2026-04-22

**Purpose:** Preserve the 2026-04-22 `pafio` external audit findings as durable tracked work after removing the ignored temporary defect ledger.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-13

## Scope

This backlog migrated the former ignored `docs/audit/defects/STYIO-PAFIO-2026-04-22.md` record into tracked planning ownership. The migration does not claim unresolved defects are fixed. It gives each finding a stable identifier, owner stream, closure rule, and verification gate so that audit scope can stay clear while real work remains visible.

## Closure Rules

1. Keep the `PAFIO-AUD-*` identifiers stable until the finding is either fixed or explicitly superseded.
2. Do not close an item with documentation alone when the finding describes unsafe runtime behavior.
3. Closure evidence must name the code change, regression coverage, data or resource lifecycle proof, and gate command.
4. If a finding moves to a GitHub issue or downstream platform task, record the durable link before removing it from this backlog.
5. Run `./scripts/delivery-gate.sh --mode checkpoint` and external `styio-audit gate --repo /home/unka/pafio --project pafio` before declaring the backlog migration complete.

## Backlog

| ID | Status | Owner stream | Finding | Required closure |
|----|--------|--------------|---------|------------------|
| PAFIO-AUD-001 | Tracked | Registry / Publish | Registry v2 control-plane publish can use server-side registry keys without explicit auth or local-origin protection. | Add publish/verify auth and origin controls for local control-plane use; add negative tests proving unauthenticated publish is rejected. |
| PAFIO-AUD-002 | Fixed, evidence retained | Registry / Publish | `/status` previously disclosed local registry and key paths. | Keep status responses redacted; retain regression evidence in `docs/audit/EXTERNAL-AUDIT-2026-04-22.md` and `tests/interop/registry-v2-control-plane-http.sh`. |
| PAFIO-AUD-003 | Fixed, evidence retained | Registry / Publish | Control-plane request bodies previously had no read bound. | Keep `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` and body timeout enforcement; retain regression evidence in the control-plane HTTP gate. |
| PAFIO-AUD-004 | Fixed for public client root pinning, residual tracked | Registry / Publish | Registry verification still needs an external trust anchor for non-local registries instead of trusting only metadata fetched from the registry under verification. | Public remote fetches now require an imported platform descriptor and verify `trust/root.json` against the pinned SHA-256. Residual: add malicious self-signed-root integration coverage and full threshold policy in PAFIO-AUD-011. |
| PAFIO-AUD-005 | Tracked | Registry / Publish | Remote registry reads need complete timeout, size-cap, and media-policy enforcement. | Add per-object response size caps and content expectations for role metadata and artifacts; add slow and oversized endpoint tests. |
| PAFIO-AUD-006 | Tracked | Registry / Publish | Archive manifest discovery needs per-member size limits in addition to canonical member selection. | Reject oversized candidate manifests before reading them into memory; add archive intake regressions. |
| PAFIO-AUD-007 | Tracked | Core / Workflow | Bootstrap CLI still exposes commands that return `BootstrapNotImplemented`. | Either hide/rename future commands behind explicit experimental grammar or route them to implemented native paths with CLI tests. |
| PAFIO-AUD-008 | Partially fixed, residual tracked | Registry / Publish | Native registry fetch validates shape and hashes but does not yet enforce registry v2 trust-chain parity with the Python verifier. | Native remote fetch now fails closed without a descriptor pin and validates `trust/root.json` against that pin. Residual: full Python verifier parity for signed timestamp/snapshot/targets threshold, expiry, and monotonic-version rules remains tracked by PAFIO-AUD-011. |
| PAFIO-AUD-009 | Tracked | Registry / Publish | Native registry checkout needs pre-extraction tar entry validation. | Pre-scan and reject absolute paths, `..` segments, links, and special files before extraction; add malicious archive tests. |
| PAFIO-AUD-010 | Tracked | Registry / Publish | Registry publish and native paths need one strict package identity policy. | Reuse one namespace/name validator across Python and native registry paths; test traversal, slash, dot, and backslash cases. |
| PAFIO-AUD-011 | Tracked | Registry / Publish | Registry v2 trust policy still needs threshold, expiration, freeze, and monotonic-version enforcement. | Enforce thresholds, expiry, and monotonic metadata versions; add expired and under-threshold regression tests. |
| PAFIO-AUD-012 | Fixed for scoped runtime paths, residual tracked | Core / Workflow | Runtime subprocesses now have scoped wall-clock timeouts, but timeout configurability and curl low-speed controls remain residual work. | Preserve current timeout tests and add follow-up coverage when timeout policy becomes configurable or curl-specific controls are added. |
| PAFIO-AUD-013 | Tracked | Registry / Publish | Native registry path normalization must match Python verifier segment policy before lexical normalization. | Align native path validation with verifier semantics and add native/Python parity tests. |
| PAFIO-AUD-014 | Fixed for registry descriptor/status/publish/verify boundary, evidence retained | Styio / Contracts | Control-plane domain failures should not be reported as HTTP success envelopes at the transport boundary. | Registry control-plane failures return non-2xx transport status with machine-readable envelopes; descriptor and status regressions are covered by native platform tests. |
| PAFIO-AUD-015 | Tracked | Registry / Publish | Registry server gate summaries need stronger redaction for publish headers, policy paths, and full commands. | Redact sensitive headers, local paths, and command details in summaries; add regression coverage. |

## Migration Evidence

The temporary defect ledger has been moved here instead of being marked closed. Existing fixed evidence remains in the tracked external audit and agent shard notes:

1. `docs/audit/EXTERNAL-AUDIT-2026-04-22.md`
2. `docs/audit/agent-findings/pafio-registry-2026-04-22.md`
3. `docs/audit/agent-findings/pafio-core-process-2026-04-22.md`
4. `docs/audit/agent-findings/pafio-subprocess-timeouts-2026-04-22.md`

The durable backlog state is complete only when this migrated audit scope has no open defect queue records and external `styio-audit` reports zero blocking findings.

## 2026-05-02 Registry Trust Closure Evidence

- `styio-cloud` owns `/api/pafio-registry-control/v1/descriptor` and returns
  the registry read root, control-plane base URL, and pinned `trust/root.json`
  SHA-256.
- `pafio` exposes `pafio registry trust import` and
  `pafio registry trust status --json`; imported pins are stored under
  `PAFIO_HOME/registry/trust/registry-trust.json`.
- Native remote HTTP registry fetches fail closed when no descriptor pin exists
  or when the fetched root metadata digest does not match the imported pin.
- Verified locally with:
  `cmake --build build-codex --target pafio_native_tests -j2`,
  `./build-codex/bin/pafio_native_tests --gtest_filter='SecurityTests.*Registry*'`,
  `cmake --build build-codex --target pafio -j2`, and
  `./build-codex/bin/pafio --help`.
```

## source-006-pafio-bootstrap-checklist: Pafio Bootstrap Checklist

```text
# Pafio Bootstrap Checklist

**Purpose:** Provide a compact bootstrap summary without duplicating the detailed task definitions and gate commands owned elsewhere.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-09

## Summary

The bootstrap stage is considered prepared when these areas all have an owner, a TODO list, and a gate:

- repository independence
- manifest and lockfile core
- compatibility and machine handshake
- resolver and cache
- CLI workflow
- external compiler integration
- verification infrastructure
- repository split runbook

## Detailed Owners

Detailed workstream TODOs live in:

- `Pafio-Workstreams-and-TODOs.md`

Detailed phase ordering lives in:

- `Pafio-Master-Plan.md`

Detailed gate commands and pass criteria live in:

- `../operations/Pafio-Verification-Matrix.md`

Detailed migration procedure lives in:

- `../operations/Pafio-Repo-Split-Runbook.md`

## Final Bootstrap Closure

Bootstrap planning is only considered closed when:

- `styio_contract_compat_gate` is green
- `pafio_extractability_gate` is green
- `styio_pafio_dual_maintenance_gate` has a documented preflight entry point

## Known Defect

- This file is intentionally only a summary; anyone trying to treat it as the source of truth for detailed tasks will recreate the original drift problem.

## source-007-pafio-future-direction-and-styio-coordination: Pafio Future Direction and Styio Coordination

```text
# Pafio Future Direction and Styio Coordination

**Purpose:** Define the next development direction for `pafio`, the engineering qualities it should optimize for, and the shared coordination expectations that `styio` developers also need to reference.

**Audience:** `pafio` maintainers, `styio` maintainers, and anyone planning cross-repository compiler/package-manager work.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-12

## 1. Why This Document Exists

`pafio` is no longer only a bootstrap scaffold. It already has:

- a native `C++20` core
- a real manifest and lockfile model
- a real resolver for workspace, path, pinned git, and registry sources
- dry-run compile-plan emission
- local packaging, registry publication, and registry consumption through a static repository layout
- managed `styio` installation, switching, and project pinning

That creates a new problem: the project no longer needs only phase checklists. It needs a shared direction document that explains what kind of package manager it is trying to become and which cross-team interfaces must mature first.

## 2. Product Direction

The intended direction is:

- Cargo-like in contract clarity, workspace discipline, and reproducibility
- Vite-like in development feedback speed
- not npm-like in implicit behavior, weak lock semantics, or permissive dependency-tree ambiguity

This means `pafio` should prefer:

- explicit manifests
- deterministic lock behavior
- explicit compiler/toolchain selection
- hermetic and inspectable cache/layout rules
- fast local iteration once the compiler-facing phase is live

It should avoid:

- hidden source discovery
- silent dependency graph rewrites
- environment-sensitive default behavior that is hard to reproduce in CI
- coupling to `styio` internals for the sake of short-term convenience

## 3. Agility Goal

The target is not 鈥渇lexible at any cost.鈥� The target is 鈥渇ast while staying predictable.鈥�

For this project, agility means:

- fast edit-to-feedback loops
- low-friction workspace operations
- cheap cache reuse
- direct and stable diagnostics
- minimal ceremony for common local workflows

For this project, agility does not mean:

- skipping lockfiles
- weakening compiler compatibility gates
- letting package resolution become opaque
- hiding important state in process-local heuristics

## 4. Directional Principles

### 4.1 Keep the Boundary Clean

`pafio` and `styio` must continue to integrate only through:

- published CLI commands
- machine-readable handshake payloads
- versioned compile-plan contracts
- stable diagnostics

This is the most important architectural rule because it preserves split-repository independence.

### 4.2 Make the Fast Path the Normal Path

Once the compiler-facing phase is live, the normal developer loop should be:

- `pafio build`
- `pafio run`
- `pafio test`
- watch-mode variants for the same commands

without extra wrapper scripts, manual cache cleanup, or hidden compiler wiring.

### 4.3 Prefer Deterministic State Over Implicit Magic

The project should continue to favor:

- canonical manifest and lock write-back
- stable cache keys
- explicit output directories
- explicit workspace and target selection

This may feel stricter than some ecosystems, but it is what keeps large workspaces debuggable.

### 4.4 Optimize for Black-Box Verification

Every important cross-team feature should be testable against a released binary and a temporary project root.

If a capability cannot be validated through a black-box gate, it is not yet ready to anchor a split-repository workflow.

## 5. Priority Order

The next work should be sequenced in this order.

### 5.1 First Priority: Live Compiler Workflow

Goal:

- turn dry-run compile-plan generation into real non-dry-run `build/run/test`

Why first:

- this is the most important missing user-facing capability
- it is also the main blocker to delivering a truly fast development loop

Needs from `styio`:

- published `styio --compile-plan <path>`
- accurate `supported_contracts.compile_plan` advertisement
- stable diagnostics and output-directory behavior

`pafio` work after that interface lands:

- build receipt writing
- compiler-result harvesting
- real non-dry-run execution
- black-box workflow gate activation

### 5.2 Second Priority: Fast Feedback Tooling

Goal:

- make local iteration feel immediate instead of batch-oriented

High-value features:

- `pafio build --watch`
- `pafio test --watch`
- cached incremental rebuilds keyed by compile-plan identity
- direct artifact reuse when graph, toolchain, and profile state have not changed

This is where `pafio` should learn from Vite-like development ergonomics, even though it remains a package manager/orchestrator rather than a frontend dev server.

### 5.3 Third Priority: Registry Distribution and Trust

Goal:

- move from 鈥渃an publish and consume through a shared static registry鈥� to 鈥渃an do it with stronger trust and operational discipline鈥�

High-value features:

- remote registry auth and account policy on top of the existing static layout
- stronger checksum and trust policy
- registry-aware vendoring and offline guarantees
- install/resolve workflows that work equally against local and cloud-hosted repositories

Reasoning:

- the current registry path now has local and remote publish plus registry consumption, and the repository layout is already static-host friendly
- the next meaningful gap is no longer remote publication itself; it is trust, auth, and operational hardening

### 5.4 Fourth Priority: Reproducible Supply-Chain Hardening

Goal:

- strengthen CI and offline operation once registry consumption exists

High-value features:

- stronger checksum/index validation
- vendor consistency checks
- content-addressed source and artifact caches
- stricter `--locked` / `--offline` / `--frozen` behavior for all relevant workflows

### 5.5 Fifth Priority: Large-Workspace Ergonomics

Goal:

- make multi-package development fast without weakening graph discipline

High-value features:

- workspace filters
- target filters
- affected-package selection
- patch/override model for local development

## 6. Shared Responsibilities

### 6.1 Pafio Owns

- manifest and lock semantics
- resolver policy
- compile-plan schema publication
- cache/layout rules on the package-manager side
- package-manager CLI surface
- black-box acceptance tooling for the compiler boundary

### 6.2 Styio Owns

- published compiler behavior
- handshake payload correctness
- compile-plan execution semantics on the compiler side
- diagnostics emitted by compiler workflows
- artifact-generation behavior inside declared output directories

### 6.3 Shared Accountability

Both teams are jointly responsible for:

- keeping the handoff spec accurate
- keeping fake compiler fixtures aligned with the published contract
- keeping black-box gates green against released binaries

## 7. What Styio Developers Need to Watch

`styio` developers do not need to follow every package-manager detail, but they do need to understand these direction changes because they will affect the external interface:

- compile-plan is moving from dry-run-only to live execution
- fast local development will require stable output and diagnostics behavior
- future build receipts and cache reuse depend on deterministic compiler outputs
- registry growth will increase the importance of reproducible diagnostics and artifact identity

In practice, the `styio` team should watch these documents together:

- [Styio-External-Interface-Requirement-Spec.md](../external/for-styio/Styio-External-Interface-Requirement-Spec.md)
- [Styio-Public-Interface-Roadmap.md](../external/for-styio/Styio-Public-Interface-Roadmap.md)
- [Pafio-CLI-Contract.md](../governance/Pafio-CLI-Contract.md)
- this document

## 8. Non-Goals for the Near Term

The project should not dilute effort into these before the higher-priority items above are complete:

- compiler-internal embedding APIs
- remote registry auth and account systems before the current trust and build/run/test priorities are in place
- overly flexible multi-version dependency semantics before the current single-version registry path is hardened
- convenience shortcuts that bypass compile-plan or handshake validation

## 9. Practical Definition of Success

This direction will be working when all of these are true:

1. A released `styio` binary passes the handoff gate and execute-path gates.
2. `pafio build/run/test` work end-to-end against a published compiler without source-tree coupling.
3. The common local workflow feels fast enough that developers do not need ad hoc wrapper scripts.
4. Registry consumption exists with explicit and reproducible lock behavior.
5. Large workspaces can target only the packages they are actively touching.

## 10. Known Tradeoffs

- This direction is stricter than ecosystems that accept more ambiguity.
- It puts more upfront pressure on interface design and black-box validation.
- The payoff is a package manager that can stay fast and reliable as the language and ecosystem grow.

# Pafio Master Plan

**Purpose:** Provide the full delivery map for `pafio` from bootstrap scaffold to split-ready package manager, while preserving strict decoupling from `styio`.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-23

## 1. Scope

`pafio` is responsible for:

- project initialization
- manifest and lockfile management
- dependency resolution
- cache and build-directory management
- project-level workflow commands
- compatibility checks against published `styio` builds
- local source-build workflow against the official `styio` source origin
- local cloud execution-policy and build-job-request contract baselines

`pafio` is not responsible for:

- parsing Styio source semantics
- reimplementing the compiler
- embedding `styio` internals
- inventing unpublished language features
- pretending the tracked open-source tree already ships the future remote control plane

## 2. Non-Negotiable Constraints

- `pafio` must remain movable as a self-contained subtree and later as its own repository.
- `pafio` may talk to `styio` only through process boundaries and versioned machine contracts.
- `pafio` releases trail the `styio` releases they support.
- `pafio` must only assume compile-plan support for versions that `styio` advertises and the compatibility matrix enables.
- source, cache, build output, test temp data, and integration fixtures must remain isolated.
- `pafio` implementation work after the bootstrap freeze should converge on a native `C++20` + `CMake` codebase, aligned with `styio`'s operational toolchain but not coupled to compiler internals.

## 2.1 Current Delivery Snapshot

This plan still owns the long-range phase map, but readers should not infer that phases `0-6` are all still equally incomplete.

Current tracked baseline:

- phases `0-3` are materially implemented in the native tree
- local `build/run/test` dry-run workflow and source-build mode are implemented
- binary-mode `build/run/test` compile-plan v1 execution is active through `styio --compile-plan`
- local registry publish/fetch transport is implemented for filesystem roots and anonymous HTTP roots
- project-local cloud execution policy, worker-pool-key, and build-job-request contracts are implemented

Still explicitly partial:

- release-matrix hardening around compile-plan remains ongoing
- the enterprise async remote control plane remains future work
- auth, signatures, and stronger registry trust hardening remain future work

For the current implementation-stage view, use [Pafio-Stage-Review-and-Future-Features.md](./Pafio-Stage-Review-and-Future-Features.md) alongside this plan.

## 3. Delivery Phases

### Phase 0. Bootstrap Independence

Deliverables:

- self-contained `pafio/` tree
- bootstrap CLI scaffold
- manifest/lockfile validation stubs
- extractability self-check
- developer context pack for `styio`

Exit gate:

- `pafio_extractability_gate`

Primary defect:

- historical bootstrap phase; real dependency orchestration now lives in later native phases

### Phase 1. Compatibility and Public Handshake

Deliverables:

- published `styio --machine-info=json`
- `pafio` compatibility matrix
- `pafio check --styio-bin ...`
- compatibility unit tests and black-box probe

Exit gate:

- `styio_contract_compat_gate`

Primary defect:

- historical handshake-only phase; project compilation now depends on the compile-plan-live gate

### Phase 2. Manifest, Lockfile, and Workspace Core

Deliverables:

- stable `pafio.toml` schema
- stable `pafio.lock` schema
- frozen `toolchain`, `lib` / `bin`, and workspace membership rules
- canonical write-back behavior
- workspace validation rules
- native `C++20` implementation of the phase-2 core
- fixture coverage for success and failure cases

Exit gate:

- `pafio_manifest_lock_gate`

Primary defect:

- schema may still need revision once compile-plan and module import rules solidify

### Phase 3. Resolver and Cache

Deliverables:

- `path` resolution
- `git` resolution
- hermetic `PAFIO_HOME`
- stable cache partition keys
- dependency tree rendering

Exit gate:

- `pafio_resolver_gate`

Primary defect:

- no registry yet, and single-version resolution is intentionally conservative

### Phase 4. Compile-Plan Contract

Deliverables:

- published `compile-plan/v1`
- schema fixtures
- compatibility rules for plan negotiation
- `styio` consumer side published separately

Exit gate:

- `contract_schema_gate`

Primary defect:

- this phase depends on `styio` publishing a real consumer; `pafio` must not guess ahead
- local source-build and dry-run plan emission do not close this phase by themselves

### Phase 5. Build / Run / Test Workflow

Deliverables:

- `pafio build`
- `pafio run`
- `pafio test`
- profile mapping
- isolated output layout under project-local `.pafio/`

Exit gate:

- `pafio_workflow_gate`

Primary defect:

- real usefulness appears only after compile-plan is accepted by published `styio`
- the tracked native tree already implements dry-run workflow payloads and local source-build orchestration, but published binary-mode execution still depends on the compiler-side consumer

### Phase 6. Publish / Registry / Tool Install

Deliverables:

- reproducibility workflow flags
- project-local vendor state
- source package format
- `pafio vendor`
- `pafio pack`
- `pafio publish`
- `pafio tool install`
- project-local toolchain pinning
- fake registry and later real registry rollout

Exit gate:

- `styio_pafio_dual_maintenance_gate`

Primary defect:

- if introduced too early, registry work will consume time before local workflow is complete
- local filesystem and anonymous HTTP registry transport are already live; remaining work is concentrated in auth, trust hardening, and higher-scale deployment models

## 4. Critical Path

The real critical path is:

1. independence
2. public compiler handshake
3. manifest/lock stability
4. resolver/cache
5. compile-plan publication
6. build/run/test orchestration

Anything registry-related is downstream of that path.

## 5. Parallel Work Policy

The implementation should be split into independent workstreams with disjoint ownership where possible:

- contracts
- CLI/bootstrap
- manifest/lock
- resolver/cache
- test infrastructure
- migration tooling

Each workstream must end in a gate that can be run without hidden local state.

## 6. Readiness Definition for Repository Split

`pafio` is split-ready when all of the following are true:

- the subtree copies cleanly to `/Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/pafio`
- bootstrap and extractability checks pass in the copied tree
- external `styio` handshake passes through `PAFIO_STYIO_BIN` or `--styio-bin`
- no `pafio` code reads `styio/src` or `styio/tests`
- developer documentation inside `pafio/docs` is sufficient for a new maintainer to work against published `styio` interfaces

## 7. Known Defects in the Overall Plan

- The plan is intentionally front-loaded with contracts and discipline, which slows short-term feature velocity.
- `compile-plan` remains the largest external dependency because it requires a published `styio` interface.
- Single-version resolution reduces ambiguity but will reject some dependency graphs that more permissive ecosystems accept.
- Migration safety increases documentation volume; this is useful but can drift if not maintained.
- Python registry/control-plane tooling may coexist with the native C++ path where it owns contract generation, signing, verification, or backend orchestration.

## source-009-pafio-native-target-split: Pafio Native Target Split

```text
# Pafio Native Target Split

**Purpose:** Define the native target graph inside `src/` so backend/service work can evolve independently from the CLI shell and the repo-hosted control console frontend.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-21

## Problem

`pafio` already has a product split between:

1. `frontend/console/` as the repo-hosted human control console
2. `src/` as the backend/domain implementation surface

But the native build graph used to collapse all backend, package, workflow, toolchain, registry, and CLI code into one `pafio_core` target. That made future extraction harder because every new binary or service-side entrypoint would inherit the CLI shell by default.

## Fixed Native Target Families

The native split now treats `src/` as three layers:

1. shared backend foundations
   `pafio_foundation`, `pafio_manifest`, `pafio_resolution`
2. backend/service domains
   `pafio_toolchain_service`, `pafio_package_service`, `pafio_project_service`
3. CLI shell
   `pafio_cli_support`, `pafio_cli_commands`, `pafio_cli_shell`

`pafio_backend_services` is the aggregation edge for service-side reuse. The `pafio` executable links the CLI shell only.

## Ownership Rules

1. New package, registry, project-graph, workflow, publish, or toolchain logic belongs in backend/service targets, not in CLI shell targets.
2. `PafioCLI/CLI.cpp` remains a routing shell and must not become a second service layer.
3. Future hosted/control-plane binaries should compose from backend/service targets and must not depend on `pafio_cli_shell` unless they intentionally expose CLI behavior.
4. `frontend/console/` must stay decoupled from `src/` implementation details and consume published contracts instead of direct native coupling.
5. If a new domain needs public machine payloads, the owning contract still lives under `contracts/` or `docs/governance/`, not inside this planning note.

## Immediate Outcome

This split is not yet a process-level service decomposition. It is the native build-graph prerequisite for that next step:

1. service binaries can be introduced without dragging the CLI shell along
2. backend domains can be tested and linked independently
3. the repo-hosted console frontend remains a separate product surface
```

## source-010-pafio-package-manager-maturity-gap-analysis: Pafio Package Manager Maturity Gap Analysis

```text
# Pafio Package Manager Maturity Gap Analysis

**Purpose:** Rank the current gaps between `pafio` and mature package-manager behavior, from highest to lowest priority, so implementation work can close capability gaps without overstating the current product surface.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-19

## Current Baseline

`pafio` is no longer a package-manager scaffold. The current tree has real manifest and lockfile parsing, canonical write-back, workspace/path/git/registry resolution, `single-version-v1` locking, dependency editing, `sync`, `fetch`, `tree`, `vendor`, deterministic source packaging, registry publish and fetch paths, registry trust descriptor import, managed `styio` installation and switching, project-local toolchain pins, and dry-run or live workflow handoff through the `styio` compile-plan boundary.

The remaining gaps are therefore not basic command names. They are the maturity layers that make a package manager safe, ergonomic, reproducible, and operable at ecosystem scale.

This document uses mature package managers such as Cargo, Go modules, npm, pnpm, uv, and rustup as reference points. It does not require `pafio` to copy their exact user experience; it uses them to identify expected capability classes.

## Priority Order

### P0. End-To-End Workflow Reliability

These gaps block `pafio` from feeling like the default developer workflow.

| Rank | Gap | Current state | Mature package-manager expectation | Closure target |
|------|-----|---------------|------------------------------------|----------------|
| P0-1 | Release-hardened `build`, `run`, and `test` execution | Compile-plan v1 handoff exists, but release hardening and matrix coverage are still ongoing. | Normal build/test/run commands work without wrapper scripts and produce inspectable artifacts, diagnostics, and repeatable failure modes. | Published `styio` binaries pass compile-plan gates across supported targets; `pafio` writes stable receipts and captures compiler output roots for every non-dry-run workflow. |
| P0-2 | Fast local feedback loop | Workflow commands are functional, but watch mode and incremental cache reuse are not a first-class developer path. | Common commands provide fast repeated execution through incremental rebuilds, watch mode, and stable cache keys. | Add `pafio build --watch`, `pafio test --watch`, and artifact reuse keyed by graph, toolchain, target, profile, and source digest. |
| P0-3 | Black-box integration coverage | Native fixtures are strong, but the open defect record still calls out placeholder or optional integration coverage. | Core install, resolve, lock, offline, registry, failure, rollback, and CI paths are proven by runnable black-box suites. | Replace placeholder integration runners with real package-manager scenarios and make them part of CTest and CI. |
| P0-4 | CI parity with release gates | CI can skip some audit or health checks depending on profile. | The PR path and release/checkpoint path prove the same package-manager invariants or explicitly document equivalent coverage. | Align CI, submit, delivery, health, and external audit checks so a green PR cannot bypass required package-manager gates. |
| P0-5 | Supported release artifact matrix | Alpha docs defer some platform artifacts and self-contained archives. | Fresh-machine installation works on every advertised platform, with verified binaries and clear upgrade/removal semantics. | Publish real `pafio` and `styio` prebuilts for the advertised matrix, including x86_64 Linux when claimed, and verify `pafio doctor` on each target. |

### P1. Registry And Supply-Chain Trust

These gaps block public or multi-publisher registry operation.

| Rank | Gap | Current state | Mature package-manager expectation | Closure target |
|------|-----|---------------|------------------------------------|----------------|
| P1-1 | Hosted authenticated publish service | A local HTTP control-plane reference and local v2 worker exist; hosted tenancy and auth policy are future work. | Registry publication requires authenticated publishers, namespace authorization, scoped tokens, rate limits, and audit logs. | Implement or integrate the hosted publish control plane with publisher identity, namespace ownership, token scopes, and append-only audit logs. |
| P1-2 | Namespace and ownership governance | Namespace policy is documented as a production requirement, but not a shipped ecosystem service. | Packages have owners, maintainers, delegation, transfer, recovery, and dispute workflows. | Add namespace ownership records, owner management commands or service APIs, and gates that reject unauthorized publish/yank/deprecate actions. |
| P1-3 | Full registry trust policy | Current clients pin `trust/root.json` through imported descriptors and verify source artifact digests; full signed timestamp/snapshot/targets parity remains residual work. | Clients verify signatures, thresholds, expiry, monotonic versions, snapshot digests, revocation, and replay protection. | Enforce timestamp, snapshot, targets, threshold, expiry, monotonic-version, and revocation rules in the native client and test malformed metadata. |
| P1-4 | Key rotation and revocation | Role keys and signed metadata exist, but production rotation workflows are not complete. | Registries can rotate compromised or expired keys without breaking safe clients. | Define root rotation, targets delegation, key revocation, recovery, and client update behavior with positive and negative tests. |
| P1-5 | Transparency log maturity | The registry uses a signed hash-chain checkpoint, not a full public transparency system. | Clients can detect equivocation and replay using persisted checkpoints or a verifiable transparency structure. | Add persisted client checkpoints, replay detection, checkpoint consistency checks, and a future Merkle tile or equivalent scalable log format. |
| P1-6 | Package provenance and attestation | SHA-256 verification exists; signed provenance is deferred. | Packages can prove builder identity, source revision, build recipe, and artifact custody. | Emit and verify source provenance, build provenance, signing identity, and release pipeline evidence for published artifacts. |
| P1-7 | Vulnerability and advisory workflow | No first-class advisory database, `pafio audit`, or dependency vulnerability check is present. | Users can audit lockfiles against advisories and receive actionable remediation data. | Add advisory schema, registry or mirror distribution, lockfile audit command, severity policy, ignore/expiry rules, and CI integration. |
| P1-8 | License and policy enforcement | General dependency usage docs exist, but package resolution does not enforce license or policy decisions. | Organizations can block packages by license, source, provenance, age, or registry trust tier. | Add policy files, package metadata fields, resolver/publish checks, and machine-readable policy violations. |
| P1-9 | Secure credential storage and enterprise network config | Public builds reserve auth hooks but do not ship credential storage or corporate proxy/cert policy. | Credentials are stored outside manifests, support keychains or env-backed providers, and respect proxies and custom CAs. | Add credential provider boundaries, secure storage guidance, proxy/cert configuration, redaction tests, and auth-specific private gates. |
| P1-10 | Yanking, deprecation, and state transitions | The v2 protocol reserves yank/deprecate actions, but user-facing lifecycle commands and hosted behavior are not complete. | Maintainers can yank, deprecate, undeprecate, and explain release status without mutating artifacts. | Add publish-control-plane actions, read-side state interpretation, CLI UX, lock behavior, and tests for yanked/deprecated releases. |

### P2. Resolver, Lockfile, And Offline Maturity

These gaps separate the current conservative resolver from mature ecosystem dependency management.

| Rank | Gap | Current state | Mature package-manager expectation | Closure target |
|------|-----|---------------|------------------------------------|----------------|
| P2-1 | Semver range solving | Registry dependencies require exact `version = "x.y.z"` and `single-version-v1` rejects competing versions. | Users can express compatible ranges, prerelease policy, minimum versions, and update constraints while retaining deterministic locks. | Add a range syntax, solver policy, prerelease rules, conflict diagnostics, and lockfile recording of selected versions. |
| P2-2 | Selective update and upgrade commands | `sync` refreshes the active graph; there is no mature `update`, `upgrade`, or minimal-change resolver UX. | Users can update one package, update transitive dependencies, apply conservative or eager strategies, and inspect changes. | Add `pafio update`, selective lock refresh, lock diff summaries, and solver strategy flags. |
| P2-3 | Conflict explanation | Resolution errors fail closed, but mature "why this version" and conflict traces are not complete. | Users can ask why a package/version is present and why a constraint failed. | Add `pafio tree --why`, conflict traces, selected-version explanations, and JSON diagnostics for solver failures. |
| P2-4 | Feature flags and optional dependencies | Published records reserve feature declarations, but manifest, resolver, and build workflows do not yet support mature feature selection. | Users can enable features, optional deps, default features, and target-specific dependency sets reproducibly. | Add manifest syntax, feature unification policy, lockfile recording, publish metadata, and build-plan propagation. |
| P2-5 | Target/platform conditional dependencies | Current manifests separate runtime and dev dependencies, but not target-conditional or platform-specific dependency graphs. | Packages can declare dependencies for OS, architecture, ABI, profile, and toolchain conditions. | Add target condition syntax, resolver evaluation, lock representation, and package metadata validation. |
| P2-6 | Registry vendoring | `pafio vendor` focuses on pinned git snapshots; registry-era vendoring remains incomplete. | Offline builds can commit or mirror exact registry sources and metadata with verification. | Vendor registry metadata, blobs, trust pins, and extracted snapshots; add `vendor --check` and offline CI gates. |
| P2-7 | Exact sync and environment pruning | `sync` prepares dependencies, but there is no full "make local state exactly match lock" cleanup mode. | Package managers can remove unused cached or project-local state and prove the environment matches the lock. | Add `pafio sync --exact` or equivalent, stale checkout detection, and safe cleanup of unused project-local materialization. |
| P2-8 | Cache garbage collection and repair | Manual cleanup is documented; no full cache prune/verify/repair command exists. | Users can inspect, verify, prune, and repair caches without deleting all state. | Add `pafio cache status`, `pafio cache verify`, `pafio cache prune`, and corruption recovery for git, registry, tool, and build caches. |
| P2-9 | Content-addressed source and artifact store | Registry blobs are digest-keyed, but the broader source/build cache model is not fully content-addressed. | Shared cache stores dedupe immutable sources and artifacts by digest with reproducible cache keys. | Move source archives, normalized trees, and build artifacts behind content-addressed keys and preserve project-local active outputs separately. |
| P2-10 | Lockfile portability and compatibility policy | Lockfile v1 is stable, but custom lock locations, multi-lock workspaces, and lock migration policy are narrow. | Lockfiles have explicit compatibility, migration, and workspace behavior across tool versions. | Define lockfile migration rules, forward/backward compatibility tests, optional workspace-level lock policies, and lockfile explanation tools. |

### P3. Workspace, Toolchain, And Build Ergonomics

These gaps matter once the package manager is used in larger repositories.

| Rank | Gap | Current state | Mature package-manager expectation | Closure target |
|------|-----|---------------|------------------------------------|----------------|
| P3-1 | Workspace filters and default members | Ambiguous multi-package operations require explicit package selection; graph-aware filters are not complete. | Large workspaces can target all, default members, changed packages, dependents, dependencies, or named subsets. | Add workspace default members, `--workspace`, `--exclude`, graph-aware `--filter`, changed-package selection, and affected-package test gates. |
| P3-2 | Patch, replace, and override model | Path and workspace deps exist, but there is no root-level override model for temporary local development. | Workspaces can override registry deps with local paths or alternate sources without publishing those overrides. | Add `[patch]` or `[replace]`-style workspace root syntax, publish exclusion rules, and lockfile provenance. |
| P3-3 | Workspace-only dependency intent | Local workspace resolution is inferred from source kind and package identity. | A manifest can require that a dependency resolve only from the workspace. | Add explicit workspace dependency syntax and resolver errors when a required local dependency resolves from registry/git/path instead. |
| P3-4 | Build profiles beyond current minimal/dev/release scope | `minimal`, `dev`, and `release` vocabulary exists, but profile configuration is not a mature user-controlled build model. | Profiles can control optimization, debug info, target directories, test behavior, and dependency build settings. | Add profile schema, inheritance/overrides, target-specific profile fields, and compile-plan propagation. |
| P3-5 | Toolchain component and target management | Managed `styio` install/use/pin exists, but components, target triples, and policy-driven auto-install are not mature. | Toolchain managers install components/targets, honor project minimum versions, and explain missing toolchain requirements. | Add toolchain target/component metadata, project minimum compiler constraints, optional auto-install policy, and clear failure UX. |
| P3-6 | Binary artifact selection | Registry v2 reserves binary artifact paths, but source artifacts remain the implemented authority. | Package managers can choose trusted binary artifacts by target, ABI, profile, and feature fingerprint with source fallback. | Add binary publish pipeline, lockfile binary artifact fields, selection policy, fallback rules, and verification. |
| P3-7 | Multi-registry and source replacement policy | Manifests name explicit registry URLs; global registry aliases and source replacement are not mature. | Users can configure named registries, mirrors, source replacement, and corporate policy without editing every manifest. | Add registry alias config, mirror/source replacement rules, lockfile recording of resolved roots, and policy gates. |
| P3-8 | Project configuration layering | Some project-local toolchain state exists, but general config precedence is narrow. | Config has clear precedence across CLI, env, project, user, workspace, and system scopes. | Define and implement `pafio config` or equivalent for registries, network, cache, toolchain, policy, and output settings. |
| P3-9 | Command discovery and shell UX | Core help exists, but completions, manpages, and richer command discovery are not complete. | Users get shell completions, command aliases where appropriate, stable help examples, and discoverable subcommands. | Add completion generation, manpage or reference generation, and docs gates that keep examples executable. |
| P3-10 | Package metadata richness | Package identity and dependency metadata exist, but mature metadata fields are limited. | Packages expose description, license, repository, homepage, keywords, categories, readme, authors, links, and documentation URLs. | Extend manifest, publish preflight, registry records, and package display commands with metadata validation. |

### P4. Ecosystem Services And Long-Term Operations

These gaps are lower priority for current implementation but expected in a mature ecosystem.

| Rank | Gap | Current state | Mature package-manager expectation | Closure target |
|------|-----|---------------|------------------------------------|----------------|
| P4-1 | Search, package info, and discovery | Registry roots are explicit; no public search/index service or `pafio search/info` UX exists. | Users can find packages, inspect versions, read metadata, and compare release states. | Add searchable metadata index, `pafio search`, `pafio info`, and registry-side package pages or machine endpoints. |
| P4-2 | Hosted user/account experience | Hosted tenancy is future work. | Users can create accounts, manage tokens, rotate keys, invite maintainers, and recover ownership. | Implement account APIs and operational flows outside the static read plane. |
| P4-3 | Operational metrics and observability | Local gates exist; production registry/service metrics are not a complete package-manager surface. | Operators see publish/fetch latency, error rates, cache hit rates, abuse signals, and audit trails. | Add metrics, structured logs, dashboards, and incident runbooks for registry and hosted control planes. |
| P4-4 | Mirror, proxy, and CDN freshness tooling | Split-origin promotion exists, but generic mirror health and CDN freshness UX are limited. | Operators can verify mirrors, detect stale replicas, and control proxy fallback behavior. | Add mirror verification, freshness reports, promotion status, client stale-metadata diagnostics, and mirror failover config. |
| P4-5 | Migration and deprecation tooling | Docs record compatibility constraints, but user-facing migration tooling is limited. | Users can migrate manifests, locks, config, and registry metadata across versions with clear warnings. | Add `pafio fix` or migration commands, compatibility checks, and structured deprecation reports. |
| P4-6 | Plugin or hook system | No general plugin/lifecycle script system is present, which is a deliberate safety-positive omission for now. | Mature ecosystems often provide hooks, but safe package managers constrain them carefully. | Decide whether hooks belong in `pafio`; if yes, design sandboxing, explicit opt-in, reproducibility rules, and CI policy before implementation. |
| P4-7 | Hosted web UI and documentation publishing | Registry docs describe service boundaries, not a package portal. | Public ecosystems expose package pages, docs links, download stats, ownership, advisories, and changelogs. | Build package portal endpoints only after registry identity, metadata, and advisories are stable. |
| P4-8 | Cross-language or foreign-package interoperability | `pafio` is focused on Styio packages and compiler handoff. | Some mature managers interoperate with external ecosystems or vendored native dependencies. | Defer until Styio package identity, source artifacts, and build profiles are stable. |

## Non-Gaps

The following are already materially present and should not be counted as missing without checking current implementation:

1. Manifest and lockfile parsing, validation, and canonical write-back.
2. Workspace, path, pinned git, and registry dependency source kinds.
3. Resolver-backed `lock`, `fetch`, `sync`, `tree`, `add`, and `remove`.
4. `--locked`, `--offline`, `--frozen`, and project-local vendoring for pinned git snapshots.
5. Deterministic source package archive creation.
6. Local filesystem registry publication.
7. Remote HTTP registry publication against the current control-plane boundary.
8. Static registry consumption through `file://`, `http://`, and `https://` roots.
9. Registry trust descriptor import and root digest pinning for remote fetches.
10. Managed `styio` install, update, list, uninstall, use, status, and project pinning.
11. Project graph introspection.
12. Local cloud execution-policy and build-job-request contract generation.

## Recommended Near-Term Cut

The highest-value next implementation slice should close these in order:

1. P0-3 and P0-4: turn the open test-framework defect into real black-box package-manager gates and CI parity.
2. P1-3 and P1-4: finish native registry trust-chain parity and key-rotation behavior before broader public registry use.
3. P2-6 and P2-8: make offline and cache operations operationally inspectable instead of relying on manual cleanup.
4. P2-1 and P2-2: add semver ranges and selective update only after the trust and offline layers are harder.
5. P3-1 and P3-2: improve large-workspace ergonomics after the resolver has stronger update and override semantics.

This ordering keeps the project aligned with its existing direction: deterministic state first, trust and verification before convenience, and explicit workspace behavior before broad magic.

## source-011-pafio-styio-cloud-migration-handoff: Pafio Styio Cloud Migration Handoff

```text
# Pafio Platform Migration Handoff

**Purpose:** Define the local package-manager-to-global-platform boundary after moving server, package-distribution, and compile-platform ownership into `styio-cloud`.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-24

## Ownership Boundary

`pafio` owns local package-manager behavior: manifests, lockfiles, resolver
state, package fetch, pack, local import/export, offline package use, publish
client UX, local toolchain selection, project-local Styio environment
optimization, and compatibility payload rendering needed by local CLI users.

`styio-cloud` owns global service behavior: hosted workspaces,
compile-platform execution, registry server control planes, global package
distribution, multi-region deployment nodes, mirror synchronization,
cloud-service extension contracts, cloud stress tooling, and service-side
runbooks.

## Compatibility Rule

Existing `pafio cloud` and registry server helpers may remain temporarily as
compatibility shims while `styio-cloud` gets its own CI and release path.
New service behavior should be implemented in `styio-cloud` first and then
consumed by `pafio` through contracts or released tooling.

`pafio` must keep an offline path. If the required package graph is
available through local sources, vendor output, cache entries, or imported
offline bundles, the package manager should not require `styio-cloud`.

## Docs Rule

When platform service docs change, update `styio-cloud` as the owner. This
repo should link to the platform source of truth and document only the
package-manager client contract or compatibility behavior.
```

## source-012-pafio-stage-review-and-future-features: Pafio Stage Review and Future Features

```text
# Pafio Stage Review and Future Features

**Purpose:** Summarize the current implemented `pafio` surface, capture the durable lessons from the implementation path so far, and rank the next high-value features using mature package-manager patterns as reference points.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-23

## 1. Scope and Ownership

This document is a planning summary.

It may summarize:

- the current implemented command surface
- implementation-stage gaps
- lessons learned during delivery
- recommended next features and sequencing

It does not own:

- CLI syntax or exit-code rules
- manifest or lockfile rules
- compatibility policy
- durable implementation decisions

Those remain owned by governance and ADR documents.

## 2. Stage Snapshot

As of 2026-04-21, the authoritative implementation path is the native `C++20` + `CMake` core recorded in [ADR-0002](../adr/ADR-0002-native-cpp20-cmake-phase2-core.md). The project is no longer only a bootstrap scaffold: it has a real manifest core, a real resolver, a real local packaging path, a managed local compiler lifecycle, a local source-build workflow mode, and a local cloud-execution contract baseline.

Current local validation status:

- native and contract test suite: `155/155` passing
- native workflow verification: passing
- extractability verification: passing
- styio handoff spec and black-box gate: present

The active public command surface is indexed in [Pafio-Entry-Argument-Index.md](../governance/Pafio-Entry-Argument-Index.md) and governed by [Pafio-CLI-Contract.md](../governance/Pafio-CLI-Contract.md).

## 3. Implemented Functionality by Area

### 3.1 Core Documents and Native Runtime

Implemented:

- dedicated ADR workflow under [`docs/adr/`](../adr/INDEX.md)
- native `C++20` + `CMake` implementation path
- stable top-level CLI with `--help`, `--version`, `--json`
- machine-readable `pafio machine-info`

Why it matters:

- the project now has a stable implementation spine and a stable place to record decisions
- command shape drift is reduced because syntax ownership was centralized in the argument index

Owner documents:

- [Pafio-CLI-Contract.md](../governance/Pafio-CLI-Contract.md)
- [Pafio-Entry-Argument-Index.md](../governance/Pafio-Entry-Argument-Index.md)
- [ADR-0001](../adr/ADR-0001-pafio-adopts-dedicated-adr-directory.md)
- [ADR-0002](../adr/ADR-0002-native-cpp20-cmake-phase2-core.md)
- [ADR-0003](../adr/ADR-0003-entry-argument-index-ssot.md)

### 3.2 Manifest, Lockfile, Targets, and Workspace Core

Implemented:

- native parsing and validation for `pafio.toml` and `pafio.lock`
- canonical manifest and lockfile write-back
- explicit `toolchain`, `[lib]`, `[[bin]]`, and `[[test]]` target model
- explicit workspace membership and exclusion rules
- adjacent lockfile drift detection

Current scope:

- accepted dependency sources are `workspace`, `path`, pinned `git`, and registry
- registry dependencies now use explicit `package`, `version`, and `registry` URL fields
- manifest and lock conventions are stable enough to support editing, resolving, and packaging

Owner documents:

- [ADR-0004](../adr/ADR-0004-phase2-canonical-manifest-lock-writeback.md)

### 3.3 Resolver, Graph, and Hermetic Source Cache

Implemented:

- `single-version-v1` resolver over workspace, path, pinned git, and registry
- lock generation from the active resolver graph
- read-only tree rendering from the resolver graph
- `fetch` to materialize pinned git and registry cache state
- `sync` to refresh the lockfile and materialize dependency sources through one user-facing preparation loop
- hermetic git mirrors and snapshots under `PAFIO_HOME`
- hermetic registry metadata, blob, and checkout cache under `PAFIO_HOME/registry/`
- project-local vendored git snapshots under `.pafio/vendor/`

Current behavior:

- same package name must resolve to one effective version and one effective source fingerprint
- pinned git snapshots are authoritative and path traversal outside a pinned snapshot is rejected
- registry blobs are authoritative and are verified by immutable `sha256` before extraction
- `check` is graph-aware and lock-drift-aware

Tradeoff:

- the resolver is intentionally conservative and will reject graphs that more permissive ecosystems might accept

### 3.4 Reproducible Workflow Flags

Implemented:

- `--locked`
- `--offline`
- `--frozen`
- `pafio vendor`

Why it matters:

- the project now has a first-class reproducibility surface for core workflow commands instead of relying only on convention
- vendored snapshots reduce dependence on prewarmed `PAFIO_HOME` state

Current scope:

- the current vendor implementation targets pinned git snapshots only
- vendored state lives under `.pafio/vendor/` so it does not collide with ordinary project paths such as local `vendor/` dependencies

Owner documents:

- [Pafio-CLI-Contract.md](../governance/Pafio-CLI-Contract.md)
- [Pafio-Entry-Argument-Index.md](../governance/Pafio-Entry-Argument-Index.md)
- [ADR-0019](../adr/ADR-0019-phase6-reproducible-workflow-flags-and-project-local-vendor.md)

### 3.5 Dependency Editing

Implemented:

- `pafio add`
- `pafio remove`
- `pafio sync`
- manifest canonical rewrite after successful edit
- adjacent lock refresh after successful edit
- rollback of manifest and lockfile if post-edit resolution fails

Why it matters:

- the project now has a real dependency-edit loop instead of a validate-only loop
- the project now has a default dependency preparation loop instead of making users compose `lock` and `fetch`
- dependency editing is transaction-like at the local workspace boundary

Owner documents:

- [Pafio-CLI-Contract.md](../governance/Pafio-CLI-Contract.md)
- [ADR-0010](../adr/ADR-0010-phase3-basic-dependency-edit-and-fetch-commands.md)

### 3.6 Compile-Plan Generation and Dry-Run Workflow

Implemented:

- `pafio build --dry-run`
- `pafio run --dry-run`
- `pafio test --dry-run`
- local `compile-plan v1` emission under project-local `.pafio/build/<cache-key>/plan.json`
- explicit target selection for `lib`, `bin`, and `test`
- compatibility gating that requires the published `styio` side to advertise compile-plan v1 before live execution

Important boundary:

- `pafio` owns local plan generation
- `pafio` now claims active compile-plan v1 interoperability only through the published compatibility matrix
- compiler handoff is defined explicitly through the `styio` spec and executable gate

Owner documents:

- [Pafio-CLI-Contract.md](../governance/Pafio-CLI-Contract.md)
- [Pafio-Version-Decoupling-Constraints.md](../governance/Pafio-Version-Decoupling-Constraints.md)

- [ADR-0014](../adr/ADR-0014-phase4-test-dry-run-with-explicit-test-targets.md)

### 3.6.1 Source-Build Mode and Local Toolchain State

Implemented:

- project-local `binary` and `build` workflow modes through `pafio-toolchain.lock`
- project-local `stable` and `nightly` channels
- project-local `build_mode = minimal`
- local source-build checkout and compiler build cache rooted in the official `https://github.com/eBioRing/Styio.git` source origin

Important boundary:

- `build` mode is implemented as a local source-build path
- it remains separate from the published external binary-mode compile-plan consumer
- it also does not imply that a remote build farm or distributed execution service exists

Owner documents:

- [Pafio-CLI-Contract.md](../governance/Pafio-CLI-Contract.md)
- [Pafio-Cloud-Control-Plane-Contract.md](../governance/Pafio-Cloud-Control-Plane-Contract.md)
- [Pafio-Version-Decoupling-Constraints.md](../governance/Pafio-Version-Decoupling-Constraints.md)

### 3.7 Packaging and Publish Preflight

Implemented:

- deterministic `pafio pack`
- canonical package archive generation
- workspace-aware package selection
- `pafio publish --dry-run` local preflight
- local filesystem registry publish transport with immutable archive blobs and version index entries
- remote HTTP registry publish transport over the same static layout
- registry dependency metadata in published version entries

Current limit:

- published packages may carry registry-addressable dependencies, but path/git dependencies remain invalid for publishable artifacts
- registry consumption is now live through `file://`, `http://`, and `https://` repository roots using the same static blob-and-index layout
- anonymous remote registry writes are now live through HTTP `PUT`, but auth and stronger trust hardening are still not implemented

Owner documents:

- [Pafio-CLI-Contract.md](../governance/Pafio-CLI-Contract.md)
- [ADR-0015](../adr/ADR-0015-phase4-pack-deterministic-source-archive.md)

- [ADR-0024](../adr/ADR-0024-phase6-anonymous-http-remote-registry-publish.md)

### 3.8 Managed `styio` Compiler Lifecycle

Implemented:

- `pafio tool install --styio-bin <path>`
- versioned managed compiler roots under `PAFIO_HOME/tools/styio/<channel>/<version>/`
- managed current compiler under `PAFIO_HOME/tools/styio/current/`
- `pafio tool use --version <compiler-version> [--channel <channel>]`
- `pafio tool pin (--version <compiler-version> [--channel <channel>] | --clear) [--manifest-path <path>]`
- project-local `pafio-toolchain.toml` pin files with upward discovery from the selected manifest
- compiler selection fallback order across explicit path, environment variable, project-local pin, and managed current compiler

Why it matters:

- compiler lifecycle is now durable local state instead of an ad hoc environment variable convention
- project-level compiler selection is now shareable repository state instead of only developer-local machine state
- the package manager can evolve toward a real toolchain manager without violating the decoupling contract

Owner documents:

- [Pafio-Version-Decoupling-Constraints.md](../governance/Pafio-Version-Decoupling-Constraints.md)
- [ADR-0017](../adr/ADR-0017-phase6-managed-local-styio-tool-install.md)

- [ADR-0020](../adr/ADR-0020-phase6-project-local-managed-styio-pinning.md)

### 3.9 Local Cloud Execution Baseline

Implemented:

- project-local persistence of `risk`, `lane`, and `security` in `pafio-toolchain.lock`
- deterministic cloud policy resolution
- `pafio cloud status --json`
- `pafio cloud plan --json`
- worker-pool-key and cache-policy reporting in machine-readable payloads

Important boundary:

- the tracked open-source tree currently publishes a local cloud contract baseline only
- it does **not** yet implement the future remote async control plane, queue, worker manager, or warm-pool scheduler

Owner documents:

- [Pafio-Cloud-Control-Plane-Contract.md](../governance/Pafio-Cloud-Control-Plane-Contract.md)
- [Pafio-CLI-Contract.md](../governance/Pafio-CLI-Contract.md)

## 4. What Is Still Partial or Blocked

The project is not feature-empty anymore, but three important boundaries remain explicit:

1. Real compiler execution is live for compile-plan v1, but release hardening remains.
   - published external binary-mode `build`, `run`, and `test` require a compatible `styio --compile-plan <path>` consumer.
   - non-dry-run execution must keep producing `receipt.json` and output-root materialization evidence.
   - local source-build mode exists, but it is not a substitute for the published binary compatibility matrix.
2. Registry work is only partially live.
   - local/filesystem and anonymous remote HTTP publish transport now exist
   - registry dependency resolution and fetch are live through static `file://`, `http://`, and `https://` repository roots
   - auth, signatures, and stronger trust-policy hardening are still not implemented
3. The resolver is still phase-3 conservative.
   - `single-version-v1` is a deliberate constraint, not a full semver/feature solver.
4. Cloud execution is still local-contract-only.
   - `cloud status` and `cloud plan` freeze terminology and request shape.
   - they do not yet submit remote jobs or talk to a queue or worker pool.

These are the correct current boundaries. None of them should be hidden behind optimistic wording.

## 5. Problems Encountered and Durable Lessons

### 5.1 Scattered Parameter Definitions Drift Quickly

Problem:

- command spellings and parameter rules started to spread across code, contract text, and scripts

Lesson:

- user-visible arguments need a single owner document from the beginning

What changed:

- the project created [Pafio-Entry-Argument-Index.md](../governance/Pafio-Entry-Argument-Index.md) and recorded that decision in [ADR-0003](../adr/ADR-0003-entry-argument-index-ssot.md)

### 5.2 Python Bootstrap Was Useful, Then Became Friction

Problem:

- the Python scaffold helped freeze the boundary quickly, but once the contracts stabilized it introduced a second implementation path

Lesson:

- bootstrap languages are good for freezing a contract, but bad as a long-term parallel implementation after the native path is chosen

What changed:

- the project moved the authoritative path to native `C++20` + `CMake` and kept the compiler boundary process-based

### 5.3 Manifest Rules Must Be Frozen Before Resolver Work Grows

Problem:

- scaffolding code had already started using `toolchain`, targets, and workspace structure before the native validator had fully frozen them

Lesson:

- if the manifest model is vague, resolver and workflow layers will multiply ambiguity

What changed:

- explicit `toolchain`, `lib/bin/test`, workspace membership, and canonical write-back rules were frozen before phase-3 growth

### 5.4 A Lockfile Without an Active Resolver Is Weak

Problem:

- early lock validation can only check syntax and shape; it cannot say whether the file is semantically current

Lesson:

- lockfiles become trustworthy only after the package manager can recompute the active graph and compare it to the stored graph

What changed:

- `check` and `lock --check` became resolver-backed and drift-aware

### 5.5 Pinned Git Needs Hermetic Snapshots, Not Host-Leaking Paths

Problem:

- plain filesystem path reuse from a git dependency can accidentally leak outside the pinned revision and couple results to host-local state

Lesson:

- pinned sources must be materialized into immutable snapshots, and transitive path traversal must remain inside that snapshot boundary

What changed:

- git mirrors and snapshots now live under hermetic `PAFIO_HOME` state

### 5.6 Owning a Schema Is Not the Same as Supporting the Workflow

Problem:

- once `compile-plan/v1` existed in-repo, there was a real risk of over-claiming support before the compiler consumer existed

Lesson:

- local schema ownership, local dry-run generation, and end-to-end interoperability are three different maturity levels

What changed:

- `pafio machine-info` keeps compile-plan support empty until the published compatibility matrix and compiler consumer authorize it

### 5.7 Workspace and Target Magic Becomes Expensive Fast

Problem:

- workspace roots, member selection, test targets, and default package selection become ambiguous quickly if the CLI relies on inference

Lesson:

- defaulting is useful only while ambiguity is impossible; beyond that, explicit package and target selection is cheaper than trying to be clever

What changed:

- `build`, `run`, `test`, `pack`, and `publish` all favor explicit target or package disambiguation when ambiguity exists

### 5.8 Publish Should Start With Deterministic Local Packaging, Not Registry Guesswork

Problem:

- adding a publish command before the package archive shape and preflight contract are stable creates false progress

Lesson:

- deterministic local packaging is the correct front half of publishing

What changed:

- `pack` became real first, then `publish --dry-run` reused the same archive contract

### 5.9 Tool Installation and Tool Activation Are Different Operations

Problem:

- once more than one local compiler version exists, reinstalling from a raw filesystem path is not a version management workflow

Lesson:

- install and activation must be split

What changed:

- the project now has both `tool install` and `tool use`

## 6. Industry Patterns Worth Borrowing Next

The next feature choices should not be made in isolation. Mature ecosystems already show which investments pay off.

### 6.1 Cargo: Explicit Workspaces, Profiles, Packaging Verification, Offline Modes

Useful patterns:

- workspace-wide defaults with explicit package selection and default members
- first-class build profiles
- deterministic packaging that rewrites the manifest and verifies the packaged result
- `--locked`, `--offline`, and `--frozen`
- a dedicated vendor workflow for registry and git sources

Why this matters for `pafio`:

- `pafio` already resembles Cargo structurally more than a pip/npm-style installer
- the missing pieces are not conceptual; they are the exact operational layers around reproducibility, packaging verification, and offline workflows

- [Cargo workspaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html)
- [Cargo profiles](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html)
- [cargo package](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-package.html)
- [cargo vendor](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-vendor.html)

### 6.2 rustup and Go: Toolchain Selection Must Be a Real Dependency Axis

Useful patterns:

- explicit toolchain override order
- project-local pinned toolchain files
- workspace-local minimum toolchain and preferred toolchain
- automatic or policy-driven toolchain switching only when the version requirement demands it

Why this matters for `pafio`:

- the project already treats compiler version as a first-class compatibility axis
- toolchain choice should eventually be visible at workspace level, not only through ad hoc CLI flags and global managed state

References:

- [rustup overrides](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html)
- [Go toolchains](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain)

### 6.3 Go Modules: Checksums, Proxy Separation, Workspace Sync, and Module Identity Discipline

Useful patterns:

- a checksum database independent from origin servers
- proxy and checksum trust separated from version control origin
- workspace sync back into member manifests
- vendoring and module cache discipline

Why this matters for `pafio`:

- once `pafio` gains registry transport, integrity and repeatability will matter more than raw download speed
- the current publish preflight is already compatible with an immutable source archive + checksum model

References:

- [Go modules reference](https://go.dev/ref/mod)
- [Go toolchains](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain)

### 6.4 pnpm: Content-Addressed Storage, Strict Workspace Protocols, and Monorepo Filtering

Useful patterns:

- a content-addressed shared store
- strict local-workspace dependency protocol
- graph-aware package filtering for large workspaces
- supply-chain hardening settings such as minimum release age and trust policy

Why this matters for `pafio`:

- `pafio` already has a workspace model and a hermetic home directory; a content-addressed store is a natural next step
- workspace-only dependency intent should become explicit rather than inferred
- monorepo ergonomics will matter once the resolver and build workflow are fully live

References:

- [pnpm workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces)
- [pnpm filtering](https://pnpm.io/filtering)
- [pnpm symlinked node_modules structure](https://pnpm.io/symlinked-node-modules-structure)
- [pnpm settings](https://pnpm.io/settings)

### 6.5 uv: Automatic Lock/Sync Discipline, Shared Lockfile Workspaces, and Managed Tools

Useful patterns:

- commands that automatically check lock freshness
- separate `locked`, `frozen`, and exact-sync behaviors
- shared-lock workspaces with explicit per-package execution
- dedicated managed tool environments and directories
- clear separation between disposable cache and persistent tool state

Why this matters for `pafio`:

- `pafio` already has the beginnings of these layers: lock drift checks, project-local `.pafio/`, and managed tools under `PAFIO_HOME`
- the next useful step is to make these layers more operationally precise

## 7. Highest-Value Next Features and Implementation Direction

The ranking below is based on current `pafio` state, not on ecosystem novelty alone.

### Priority 1. Real `styio --compile-plan` Execution and Build Receipts

Why it is first:

- the project already has manifest validation, a resolver, dry-run compile-plan emission, and managed compiler selection
- the largest missing value is end-to-end local build execution

Recommended implementation:

- keep the current process boundary
- extend compatibility policy only when `styio` publishes real compile-plan support
- turn non-dry-run `build`, `run`, and `test` into:
  - preflight
  - plan emission
  - compiler spawn
  - artifact capture
  - receipt write
- introduce a build receipt under `.pafio/build/<cache-key>/receipt.json` with:
  - selected compiler identity
  - compile-plan hash
  - selected package and target
  - artifact list
  - diagnostic paths
  - wall-clock timing

Important constraint:

- do not bypass the published machine contract even if `pafio` and `styio` are developed side by side

### Priority 2. Registry Transport With Integrity Before Convenience

Why it is third:

- `pack` and `publish --dry-run` already establish the front half of publishing
- registry transport is now the real missing back half

Recommended implementation:

- start with an immutable package archive plus signed or at least checksum-verified registry metadata
- separate:
  - source archive upload
  - registry index update
  - checksum publication
  - client download path
- keep private-registry and public-registry trust policy configurable from the beginning
- plan for a checksum or transparency-log model, not only origin-server trust

Good minimum target:

- registry index entry containing package name, version, digest, dependencies, and publish timestamp

Do not do first:

- do not start with mutable git-based publish semantics pretending to be a registry

### Priority 3. Content-Addressed Source and Artifact Cache

Why it is fourth:

- current hermetic directories are correct, but they are not yet fully content-addressed
- cache deduplication and artifact reuse will matter as soon as non-dry-run builds are live

Recommended implementation:

- store fetched source archives and extracted normalized trees by digest under `PAFIO_HOME/cache/`
- key compiled artifacts by:
  - compiler version
  - compile-plan major
  - package graph fingerprint
  - target identity
  - profile
  - source digest
- keep project-local `.pafio/build/` as the active working area and `PAFIO_HOME` as the reusable global store

Borrowed pattern:

- this is closer to pnpm and uv than to classic language-specific caches, and it fits `pafio`'s existing decoupling rules

### Priority 4. Workspace-Level Execution Filters and Defaults

Why it is fifth:

- once build/test are fully live, multi-package repositories will need fast, explicit targeting

Recommended implementation:

- keep `--package` as the precise selector
- add:
  - `--workspace`
  - `--exclude <package>`
  - `--filter <selector>` later
- selectors should be graph-aware, not only string-match based
- changed-package and dependent-package filters are worth doing only after the basic selector model is stable

Borrowed pattern:

- Cargo鈥檚 explicit workspace/default-members model and pnpm鈥檚 filter syntax are the most useful references here

### Priority 5. Project-Local Toolchain Pinning

Why it is sixth:

- managed compiler install/use exists, but reproducible repository-level compiler pinning does not

Recommended implementation:

- extend the toolchain model with a repository-local pin file or workspace-root toolchain block that records:
  - preferred channel
  - exact version
  - optional components/targets later if `styio` grows them
- resolve compiler choice in this order:
  - explicit CLI flag
  - environment override
  - workspace-local pin
  - managed current compiler
- keep toolchain pinning compatible with the existing machine-info handshake and compatibility matrix

Borrowed pattern:

- rustup and Go both treat the toolchain as a versioned dependency axis instead of a hidden system prerequisite

### Priority 6. Workspace-Only Dependency Intent and Patch/Override Model

Why it is seventh:

- the current resolver supports workspace/path/git, but there is no first-class way to say 鈥渢his must resolve locally鈥� or 鈥渢emporarily replace this dependency graph edge鈥�

Recommended implementation:

- add an explicit workspace-only dependency marker instead of relying on source-kind inference
- add a workspace-root override mechanism for local development, similar in spirit to Cargo鈥檚 `[patch]` or Go鈥檚 `replace`
- exclude override state from published package metadata

Why this is valuable:

- it improves local iteration speed without weakening the publish boundary

## 8. Work That Is Tempting but Premature

The following ideas are real, but they are not the highest-value next steps for the current repository state:

- a full semver + feature-flag multi-version resolver before registry transport exists
- remote compiler downloads before trust policy and checksum rules exist
- in-process `styio` integration
- automatic workspace magic that hides package or target ambiguity
- publish transport before immutable package identity and checksum story are defined

## 9. Summary

`pafio` has crossed the line from bootstrap scaffold into a functioning local package manager core. The most important thing it still lacks is not 鈥渕ore commands鈥�; it is live end-to-end compiler execution, a fuller integrity-preserving registry path, and artifact/cache discipline that extends beyond the current local offline workflow.

That is also where the best ecosystems converge: Cargo, Go, pnpm, rustup, and uv all treat reproducibility, explicit workspace behavior, toolchain identity, and cache discipline as first-class features. `pafio` should continue in that direction rather than chase surface-area growth for its own sake.

- add integration fixtures using external compiler binaries only
- map each stream to a named gate
- keep migration and extractability checks runnable from a copied subtree

Blocks:

- none for bootstrap; later phases depend on resolver and compile-plan work

Feeds:

- every acceptance gate

Gate:

- all named gates rely on this stream

Defect:

- test infrastructure can become stale if commands are renamed without synchronized fixture updates

## Workstream H. Repository Split Runbook

Ownership boundary:

- `pafio/scripts/copy-to-external-repo.sh`
- future preflight scripts
- migration docs

TODOs:

- add a single preflight command before copy
- document exact copy sequence
- document post-move checks
- keep the runbook neutral to implementation language

Blocks:

- extractability and compatibility checks must already exist

Feeds:

- actual move to `/Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/pafio`

Gate:

- `styio_pafio_dual_maintenance_gate`

Defect:

- runbook accuracy depends on keeping file layout assumptions current

## Final Closure Rule

Before declaring the planning stage complete, every workstream must have:

- clear ownership boundaries
- explicit TODOs
- one named gate
- at least one documented defect or limitation

## 2026-04-22 Closure Snapshot

### Closed (Verified by Current Test Evidence)

- `pafio_styio_interface_gate_handshake` + `pafio_styio_interface_gate_compile_plan` are passing, confirming the baseline `styio` machine-info/compile-plan handoff test path (`ctest --test-dir /home/unka/pafio/build-codex --output-on-failure`).
- Registry/control-plane and hosted API contract suites are passing in the same run (`pafio_registry_*` and `pafio_hosted_api_*` tests), which gives evidence that contract/interop lanes are stable.

### Open / Not Yet Closed

- **A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H** remain open for full stage closure unless the stream-specific TODO list is fully converted to verified acceptance items.
- Current blockers remain:
  - stream-level end-to-end behavior still exceeds test coverage of the current default suite (`pafio_native_tests_NOT_BUILT` is registered but not runnable in this environment/config).
  - several TODOs explicitly call out future-phase/implementation-behind-contract behavior, especially around remote execution and full CLI behavior guarantees (see workstream defects).
  - docs-to-runbook synchronization requires one-to-one closure on extractability and verification runbooks before stage close, as called out in stream H.

## `pafio` Checkpoint Rules

1. Any change to compiler compatibility or machine-info assumptions must be reviewed by Compat / Security.
2. Any new project graph or workflow payload must be mirrored into `styio-view` handoff docs and fixtures in the same checkpoint.
3. `pafio` may not infer unpublished compiler behavior when `styio --machine-info=json` or the published compatibility matrix can answer the question.
4. If `styio` has not published a capability, `pafio` must return a machine-readable contract error instead of guessing.
5. Any cross-repo milestone, repo exit, or checkpoint-ID change must first land in the authoritative nightly plan, then in this mirror, then in local owner docs.
